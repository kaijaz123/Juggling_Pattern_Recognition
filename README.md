# Juggling_Pattern_Recognition

# Introduction
The project provides juggling siteswap pattern recognition in either real-time or video format. The code was written and serves
as my Final-Year-Project (FYP). This repository aims to recognize the siteswap notation/pattern from notation 0 - notation 8.
