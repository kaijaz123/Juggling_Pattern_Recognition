# Juggling_Pattern_Recognition

# Introduction
The project provides juggling pattern recognition in either real-time or video format. The code was written and serves
as my Final-Year-Project (FYP). This repository provides the real time balls detection and human pose estimation as well as common classification of juggling **SITESWAP** notation from notation 1 to notation 8.
